# Project State: MOCA

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md`

**Core value:** Retrieve relevant business facts and policy evidence, provide evidence-backed guidance, and ensure risky actions pass explicit approval and execution safety contracts.
**Current focus:** Phase 11 — intent-clarification

## Current Position

Phase: 10 (state-lifecycle-routing-migration) — COMPLETE
Plan: 5 of 5
Plans: 5/5 complete
Status: Ready to plan Phase 11
Last activity: 2026-06-14 — Completed 10-05-PLAN.md

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Completed Baseline

Phase 7 Contract Baseline completed on 2026-06-06.

- Artifacts: `.planning/phases/07-contract-baseline/`
- Coverage result: `MISSING=0`
- Downstream readiness: Phase 8 and Phase 9 may proceed to planning.
- Phase 7 is docs-only and does not claim later target contracts are implemented.

## Decisions

- v1.0 remains archived as completed Phases 1-6.
- The previous v1.1 planning line was replaced at the planning level.
- v1.1 is now the Agent Architecture Migration roadmap spanning Phases 7-17.
- Phase 7-17 are standard SDK phase identities; no separate prefixed phase namespace remains.
- Source code, tests, and git history from the previous planning line were not rolled back.
- Phase 8 and Phase 9 may plan and execute in parallel after Phase 7.
- Phase 16 and Phase 17 remain named owner phases but do not block the MVP completion gate.
- Policy evidence identity uses `v{PolicyDocument.version}`; effective dates do not determine evidence identity.
- Policy re-import uses a row lock so concurrent changed-content imports serialize version bumps.
- Runtime policy retrieval uses `PolicyKnowledgeService`; the legacy `search_policy` path remains unchanged for rollback.
- Recommendation citations are validated by full `evidence_id`, and all no-action drafts are suppressed before proposed-action creation.
- Write descriptors remain declared but are hard-blocked before adapter access; action event families remain deferred to Phase 17.
- AsyncSession is passed explicitly to registry adapters and never added to ToolCallContext.
- BusinessToolService is the live registry-to-adapter composition root; callers inject only AsyncSession.
- Trusted tool permissions and merchant scope are derived in the agent-runs router and passed only through configurable run config.
- The prior-line registry remains only as an isolated policy-search compatibility path; live business reads use the Phase 9 facade.

## Blockers / Concerns

- Every phase plan must preserve coverage-matrix and follow-up-register visibility.
- Relevant `MISSING` rows block execution.
- Phase 13 must keep the active SLA scanner as an explicit owned follow-up gate.
- Phase 16/17 deferral must not weaken Phase 12 session-memory fallback or Phase 14 demo action safety.
